<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
Once the program starts working you'll be prompted with questions asking about your studio and what season you want to schedule your movie for. You'll then be given 5 different actions to choose from. Option 1 allows you to add a movie and its genre. Option 2 allows you to put a date on a movie. Option 3 allows you to postpone a movie by a year. Option 4 allows you to see the actions done so far. Option 5 ends the program and shows everything.
